# Fire_and_Dice
A dice rolling simulator that takes the user's input for number of dice and number of sides, generates and prints a random array of results as well as the sum of all random numbers.

**Example**
>Please enter a value or 'EXIT': 4D20

>You rolled [2, 17, 4, 14] and your total is 37.

Users must enter a value in a format of #D#, ##d##, or a combination of the two with positive integers. Any other entered value will result in a "Please try again" message.
